## Overview of audio files

For a detailed channel analysis, see the `.png` files next to the audio files. These files can be generated by running the `generate_channel_analysis.py` script in the `audio` directory. You could use `uv`:

```
uv run python generate_channel_analysis.py
```

Apart from analysing the audio channels and outputting a `.png` visualization, the script will also ask you to rename audio files that don't start with one of the recognized channel type prefixes. The recognized channel type prefixes are:

- `1ch` (mono)
- `2ch-acoustic` (stereo with minor acoustic differences between the channels)
- `2ch-identical` (stereo with identical content)
- `2ch-unbalanced` (stereo with one channel being significantly louder than the other)
- `2ch-distinct` (stereo with one channel being significantly different from the other so that in the context of two speakers, one speaker is significantly louder on one channel throughout)
